The motivation for the study done by Wu et al. (2020) was to shed light on the heterogeneity and functional diversification of microglia. Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages in the central nervous system. They are vital for immune defense, neural development and function, and neuroinflammation. The purpose of the study was to be one of the first to look at microglia in zebrafish to investigate the link between microglial heterogeneity and functional phenotypes. They investigated two microglia: ccl34b.1+ and 34b.1- microglia. These two microglia populations in adult zebrafish differ in morphology, distribution, development, and function, which they found influenced their response to bacterial infection. To study the microglia, they sequenced the samples from each treatment group. The reads from sequencing were aligned to a zebrafish reference genome. These aligned reads were converted to bulk RNA-seq counts.
